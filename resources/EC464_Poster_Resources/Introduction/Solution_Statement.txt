OverEar takes a signal-processing approach to sound segregation and aims to limit and localize noise robustly and effectively.
Words spoken in a noisy environment will become localized such that the sounds coming from directly in front of the user (0 degrees) are amplified while sound coming from other degrees are attenuated.
OverEar is a portable and real-time solution to the Cocktail Party Problem and uses off-the-shelf parts to create an end dive.
