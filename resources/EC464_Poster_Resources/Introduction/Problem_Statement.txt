The Cocktail Party Problem is a phenomenom where certain people, due to a hearing or neurological impairment, are not able to focus their attention on a stimulus while filtering out other distracting sounds, especially in the context of conversation in a room filled with chatter. 
Current solutions on the market are expensive, do not perform sound-separation, or use an array of microphones.
An inexpensive and more accessible device is necessary to fill this need.
