# Teensy Sound Segregation
## Guillermo Ao, Hannah Gold, Benjamin Li, Jonathan Ngo

# Overview
This repository contains the code to run a sound-segregation algorithm on the Teensy 3.5 microcontroller

# Getting Started
The Teensy add-on for Arduino is needed and can be downloaded from here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html

# Circuitry
In order for the entire device to work, the following hardware is needed:
 - Teensy 3.5
 - Teensy Audio Shield for Teensy 3.5
 - 2 MAX4466 Electret Microphones
 - Either USB or 5V external battery
 - Earbuds or Headphones
